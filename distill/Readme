a. trained vgg16 on cifar10 (cifar10vgg.py)
b. trained vgg16 on cifar100. Accuracy is 70% on validation datasets.
c. generate a specialized datasets from cifar100, with 10 categories accounting for 90% and
randomly selected the other 10%.
d. fix the non-fc layers, retrain the last three FC layers of vgg16 using weights from b on
 c. Accuracy is 95% on datasets. (cifar100vgg.py)
e. cifar10vgg.h5 is the weights from a
f. cifar100vgg.h5 is the weights from b
